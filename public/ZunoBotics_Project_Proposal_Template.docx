This is a placeholder for the DOCX template file. In a real implementation, this would be a proper DOCX file with formatted content including sections for:

1. Project Title
2. Student Information (Name, University, Contact)
3. Project Description
4. Objectives and Goals
5. Technical Requirements
6. Timeline
7. Expected Impact
8. Resource Requirements
9. Team Members (if applicable)
10. References

For now, this serves as a placeholder file that will be downloaded when users click the template download button.
